        <p>I plan to design this app to help it's users understand their financial situation regarding their active or potential loans.<br><br>
            In order to achieve this, I will be giving them the means to:
            <br>- Calculate their payments in advance<br> 
            - To be able to compare their exisitng/planned loans,<br>
         - To provide a suggestion on how to most effectively repay those loans. </p>
